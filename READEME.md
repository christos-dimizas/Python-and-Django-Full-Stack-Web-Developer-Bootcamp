**_In general is a good practice to create a virtual environment. In this way we avoid conflicts which may be produced from updated versions of our dependencies_**

To create a new env for a django app we run: `conda create --name [name of environment] django` 

Then we can install django: `conda install django`

And create a project: `django-admin startproject first_project`
